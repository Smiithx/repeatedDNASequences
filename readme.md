## repeatedDNASequences

All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as `A`, `C`, `G`, and `T`. In research, it can be useful to identify repeated sequences within DNA.

Write a function to find all the 10-letter sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule `s`, and return them in lexicographical order. These sequences can overlap.

## Example

**For** `s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"`, **the output should be**
`repeatedDNASequences(s) = ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"]`.

## Input/Output

- **[execution time limit] 4 seconds (php)**

- **[input] string s**

Guaranteed constraints:

`0 ≤ s.length ≤ 5000`.

- [output] array.string

  - An array containing all of the potential 10-letter sequences that occur more than once in s.
